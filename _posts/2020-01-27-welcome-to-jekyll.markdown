I have maintained a few blogs in a past but the maintenance can be quite painful. Not to mention that you constantly receive spam bot messages that comments on your post.

Therefore I have decided to move my blog to Github Pages for now. After a few searches I have decided to use [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] as it allows me to write my blog in markdown, which is one of my favourite languages for documentation.

Stay tuned for more posts in the future!
