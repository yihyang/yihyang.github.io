Welcome back to another post of modeling workflow. In this post we are going to model the process within a workflow.

Let's refer to our problem statement from previous flow:

**E Corp Bank** wanted to automated their workflow for their Transaction which included a process of few steps that included approvals and change of states based on different condition.

1. When a new transaction with the type "Personal Loan" is selected, and:
    1. If the amount is less than $10,000, it will start the "Low Loan Amount" workflow
    2. If the amount is more than or equal to $10,000 but less than $50,000, it will start the "Medium Loan Amount" workflow
    3. If the amount is more than or equal to $50,000, it will start the "High Loan Amount" workflow

#### "Low Loan Amount" Workflow

Let's assume the "Low Loan Amount" workflow will be fairly straight forward as implemented by it's name.

I'm going to assume that the "Low Loan Amount" workflow contain the following process:

1. Step 1 - Gathering Information
    - Gather the personal information of the user
        - Name, ID Number, Contact Number and Address
    - Gather the income information of the user
        - Job position, income and etc
2. Step 2 - Loan Information
    - Loan amount
    - Tenure
    - Calculate the monthly instalment from it


Within the workflow there are StepTemplates, with the following attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| name | string | The name of the step |
| state | string | The states of the step |
| data | json | The property to contains the data that was stored |


We have to consider transition of the states within each steps, for this we will be having a StepTransition, with contained the following attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| step_name | string | The name of the step |
| from_state | string | The current state of the step |
| to_state | string | The state of the step that will be transitioned into |
| condition | json | The condition which will allow the state of the step to be transited from
